<title>Hosting in GitHub Pages</title>
<p>The GitHub repository must be public in order to use GitHub Pages
    with a free GitHub account.</p>
<p>The root of a GitHub Pages site must come from either the
    root of the repository or a "docs" folder within the root.
    In this case, I named the directory containing the site files
    "docs" and configured GitHub Pages to use the "docs" folder as the root.</p>

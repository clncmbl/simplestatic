<h1>Using jsDelivr as a Javascript CDN</h1>
<h2>jsDelivr basics</h2>

<p>
jsDelivr provides a free Javascript CDN that is free and
easy to use.  The home page for jsDelivr is at
<a href='https://www.jsdelivr.com'>jsdelvr.com</a>.
    
<p>
Although jsDelivr can access files stored in either npm or
GitHub, I am using it only with GitHub.  Consequently, I
will not discuss its use with npm.

<p>Please see the
<a href='https://www.jsdelivr.com'>jsDelivr website</a>
for more information than I am providing here before using it.

<h2>Using jsDelivr for Javascript files in GitHub</h2>

<p>
A typical scenario in my case is that I have a Javascript
file in its source GitHub repository, and I want my web
page (hosted in an entirely separate location) to be able to
use that Javascript file.  The file could be a web component,
for example. 

<p>
(Javascript that is specific to the website and is maintained
in the same repository as the website is probably not a good
candidate for accessing through jsDelivr; the main benefits
are associated with shared Javascript libraries.)

<p>
One requirement for using jsDelivr to serve Javascript from
a GitHub repository is that the repository must be public.
Given that, anybody can access the file with a URL of the form
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/[github_account]/[repo]@[version]/[path_to_file].

<p>
An easy way to generate the correct URL is to go to
<a href='https://www.jsdelivr.com/github'>jsdelivr.com/github</a>
and paste the GitHub "raw" URL for your file.  The jsDelivr tool will then provide the corresponding jsDelivr CDN URL.

<h2>Purging the jsDelivr cache</h2>
<p>
Because jsDelivr caches the Javascript files that it serves,
you might need to purge the cache so that jsDelivr
pulls the most recent file from GitHub.  A tool for this is
available at
<a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/tools/purge">jsdelivr.com/tools/purge</a>.

<h2>But why not serve Javascript directly from GitHub?</h2>
<p>
You could serve Javascript libraries directly from GitHub, but
you would need to use GitHub Pages.  (Accessing directly through
the "raw" URL does not work because GitHub uses a MIME type
text/plain for those files.)  GitHub Pages has limitations and
lacks the features that jsDelivr provides.

<h1>Using jsDelivr as a Javascript CDN</h1>
<h2>jsDelivr basics</h2>

<p>
jsDelivr provides a free Javascript CDN that is free and
easy to use.  The home page for jsDelivr is at
<a href='https://www.jsdelivr.com'>jsdelvr.com</a>.
    
<p>
Although jsDelivr can access files stored in either npm or GitHub,
I am using it only with GitHub.  Consequently, I will not
discuss its use with npm.

<p>Please see the jsDelivr website for more information
than I am providing here before using it.

<h2>Using jsDelivr with files in GitHub</h2>

<p>
A typical scenario in my case is that I have a Javascript
file in its source GitHub repository, and I want my web
page (hosted in an entirely separate location) to be able to
use that Javascript file.  The file could be a web component,
for example.  

<p>
First, the GitHub repository containing the Javascript file
must be public.  Assuming that requirement is in place,
the website can access the file with a URL of the form
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/[github_account]/[repo]@[version]/d[path_to_file].

<p>
An easy way to generate the correct URL is to go to
<a href='https://www.jsdelivr.com/github'>jsdelivr.com/github</a>
and paste the GitHub "raw" URL for your file.  The jsDelivr tool will then provide the corresponding jsDelivr CDN URL.

<h2>Purging the jsDelivr cache</h2>
<p>
Because jsDelivr caches the Javascript files that it serves,
you might need to purge the cache.  A tool for this is
available at
<a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/tools/purge">jsdelivr.com/tools/purge</a>

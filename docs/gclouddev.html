<h1>Development in Google Cloud</h1>
<h2>Using the Google Cloud Shell Editor for development</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://cloud.google.com">cloud.google.com</a>, you can access a code editor that you can use for development.  It has a surprising number of features for a free service.  One limitation, however, is that you cannot use the editor for more than 50 hours per week.</p>
<h2>Accessing GitHub read/write from the Google Cloud Shell</h2>
<p>In this scenario, we use an existing (possibly new) repository on GitHub and then clone it into the Google Cloud Shell.</p>
<p>In the shell, create an SSH key to serve as a GitHub deploy key.  When creating the key, give it a filename indicating that it is a deploy key and indicating the repository for which it is a deploy key.  Making the name unique to the repository is especially important if the Google Cloud account will have multiple repositories; deploy keys are specific to a GitHub repository and cannot be associated with more than one repository.  Deploy keys usually do not have passwords, so be careful not to use a deploy key for more any other purpose.</p>

Here is an example of creating a deploy key for a repository named "myrepo":
<pre>
$ <b>ssh-keygen -t e25519 -c "myemail@example.com"</b>
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/me/.ssh/id_ed25519): <b>/home/me/.ssh/myrepo_deploykey</b> 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <i>[leave empty]</i>
Enter same passphrase again:  <i>[leave empty]</i>
Your identification has been saved in /home/me/.ssh/myrepo_deploykey
Your public key has been saved in /home/me/.ssh/myrepo_deploykey.pub
...
</pre>

<p>Add the key to GitHub as a read/write deploy key for the repository.</p>
<p>For the setup of multiple deploy keys (that is, if you are using multiple repositories in your Google Cloud account), see the section on multiple repositories in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys">GitHub doc on managing deploy-keys</a>.</p>
<p>So that the git commands use the correct SSH key for interacting with the GitHub server, edit (create, if necessary) ~/.ssh/config so that under the relevant Host (which should eventually match that in the .git/config file) has an IdentityFile setting that points to the newly created deploy key.</p>

<p>Following through with the same key file as created above, the ~/.ssh/config file should contain a Host entry similar to the following:</p>

<pre>
Host github.com
    IdentityFile /home/me/.ssh/myrepo_deploykey
</pre>

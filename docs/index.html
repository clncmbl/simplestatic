<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>
  My goal in creating this site is to put information that I need in order to create a simple static website.  The use case I am targeting is my own.  If others see this site and find something useful, that would greatly please me, too.
</p>
<p>
  My basic approach is to develop on Google Cloud and host on GitHub Pages.  Each content page should require only minimal overhead tags with most common functionality provided by an HTML wrapper applied with Javascript.

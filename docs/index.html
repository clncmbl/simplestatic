<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>
  My goal in creating this site is to have in one place the information that I need in order to create a simple static website.  The use case I am targeting is my own.  If others see this site and find something useful, that would greatly please me, too.
</p>
<p>
  My basic approach is to develop on Google Cloud and host on GitHub Pages.  Each content page should require only minimal common overhead tags with most common functionality provided by an HTML wrapper applied with Javascript.
</p>

<p>
  Creating content with this approach requires working in HTML and assumes knowledge of CSS.  Ideally, however, I would like to be able to create source content pages relatively readable in spite of being written in HTML.  For example, a web component that allows for a table to be authored in a readable way would be helpful.
